## 1) Taxes and Subsidy Effects on Green Technology
This was a research paper written together with Wajid Ali Qureshi where we analyze the pros and cons of taxes and subsidies. We proceed by discussing specific examples of a carbon tax in British Columbia, Canada, as well as a subsidy example using the U.S. Production Tax Credit (PTC) on renewable energy. We conclude the paper by proposing our own policy recommendation with a combination of both taxes and subsidies.
